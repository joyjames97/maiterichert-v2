                Combining my passion for exercise with education lead me to fall in love with the industry and wanting to help others understand and take control of their bodies and lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a lot of contradictory information, diets and "health hacks". I aim to help each and every one of my clients to find their own personal healthy balance and get them to reach their goals by educating them to better understand their bodies and how to reach their goals without unmaintainable diets and fake "health hacks".
              </p>
              <p>
                I focus on balance, IIFYM, HIIT and strength training offering both flexible and customized nutritional coaching and tailored exercise programs, as well as a strong and efficient mental coaching to focus on the long term results.

          <h2>My Story</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row" data-aos="fade-up">
          <p>I’ve never done any sort of sports nor physical activity whatsoever at a young age. In fact, I hated sport!</p>
          <p>But growing up I began to struggle with self image, I became obsessed with fitness but focused mostly on the aesthetics. I was skinny, weak and not fuelling my body with the right foods for energy. I began to struggle to find a healthy balance between fitness, food, my lifestyle...but also my relationships.</p>
          <p>This was the best decision of my life, yet it had some ups and downs... I went to the extreme of being so strict and restrictive, eventually I would ‘binge’ and always ended up feeling confused and out of control. At one point I used to think that cardio and cutting calories was the answer to reaching a lean, toned physique. Again, I was wrong.</p>
          <p>I felt weak and limited to the things I should be doing or eating and even felt guilty if I ate something labelled "bad" or not "clean". I was wrong once again... I even completely stopped exercising and dieting a few times (one time for almost a year) and i felt so bad again: gaining lots of weight, it was so uncomfortable for the mind and the body to the point that I couldn't look at the mirror anymore. I've been mislead by a bad coach for 6 months, who only added to the confusion and made me do 3 steps backs and one step forward. Long story short: I've seen it all.</p>
          <p>One day I got fed up with feeling stuck in this cycle, and decided to get really educated on exercise and nutrition and I never looked back! The struggle was real, but so was the grind and the rewards that come with it!</p>
          <p>Fast forward many years and it feels like a distant memory. I have found and learnt how to live a healthy balanced lifestyle while reaching my goals and staying lean, strong and healthy all year round. Not only did I change my body composition but my approach to fitness, my goals, even my attitude and view on life has done a complete turnover. I feel energized, empowered, healthy and strong. I finally love myself! I feel comfortable in my own skin, not only how it looks but appreciate the things my body is capable of doing!</p>
          <p>The hardest part for me was definitely the mental aspect and changing my thought process and obsession with ‘calories’, understanding that food is fuel, carbs aren’t the enemy (they are a macronutrient) and understanding how much to be eating and why. After being in the industry for just a short while I found that the issues I struggled with are so much more common than I thought, which lead me to get educated, start weight training the right way and including other disciplines in my routine like calisthenics, stretching, swimming, or yoga... This determination and new way of life pushed me to go on stage and achieve nothing but the best.</p>
          <p>I am now a fully qualified Online Coach, Posing Coach and Fitness Model with more than 7 years of experience. I competed in 3 shows, the first being an amateur contest in some town in Belgium, where I placed first in my category, bikini. The second and third shows I competed in were in a big league, the WBFF. In Miami, where I placed 4th within a tough competition roster, and finally in Verona (Italy) one month later, where I got rewarded with the 1st place bikini title, national champion title and a pro-card!</p>
          <p>Combining my passion for exercise with education lead me to fall in love with the industry and wanting to help others understand and take control of their bodies and lives. Let me help you find your healthy balance and live a healthier and happier life. It's never too late to start loving yourself and this begins <b>now</b>!</p>
          <p>I believe knowledge is power and there is nothing more important than understanding how your body works and what works best for you!</p>
          <p>If you are ineterested or if you want to know more, don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
